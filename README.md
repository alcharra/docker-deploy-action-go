A **reliable and efficient GitHub Action** written in Go for deploying **Docker Compose** and **Docker Swarm** services over SSH.

This action securely **uploads deployment files**, prepares the **remote environment** and automatically **provisions Docker networks** if needed. It supports **health checks, rollback** and optional **resource cleanup**, ensuring smooth and stable deployments with minimal hassle.

## Performance Comparison

The Go-based deployment tool was built with speed in mind ‚Äî here‚Äôs a real-world comparison against the original [PowerShell/Bash-based version](https://github.com/alcharra/docker-deploy-action).

### Test Details

Both tools were tested under identical conditions: a Docker Compose deployment using the same configuration file along with three additional files (~1KB each). The tests were run on the same server, using the same SSH key, network and project path, ensuring a fair comparison between the two implementations. 

### Results

| Tool            | Average Time | Fastest Time | Slowest Time |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| PowerShell/Bash | ~8.64s       | 8.38s        | 8.84s        |
| Go              | ~4.85s       | 4.82s        | 4.90s        |

‚úÖ **Result:** The Go version is consistently **~44% faster** on average.

This speed gain comes from running a single compiled binary without shell overhead, resulting in faster deployments, especially in CI environments.

## Supported Prune Types

- `none` ‚Äì No pruning (default)
- `system` ‚Äì Remove unused images, containers, volumes and networks
- `volumes` ‚Äì Remove unused volumes
- `networks` ‚Äì Remove unused networks
- `images` ‚Äì Remove unused images
- `containers` ‚Äì Remove stopped containers

## Network Management

This action ensures the required Docker network exists before deploying. If it is missing, it will be created automatically using the specified driver.

### How it works

- If the network already exists, its driver is verified.
- If the network does not exist, it is created using the provided driver.
- If `docker_network_attachable` is set to `true`, the network is created with the `--attachable` flag.
- In `stack` mode with the `overlay` driver:
  - Swarm mode must be active on the target server.
  - A warning is displayed if Swarm is not active.
- If the existing network uses a different driver than specified, a warning is displayed.

### Network scenarios

A network will be created if:
- The specified network does not exist.
- A custom network is defined via `docker_network`.
- The provided driver is valid and supported.

Warnings will be displayed if:
- The existing network's driver does not match the one specified.
- Swarm mode is inactive but `overlay` is requested in `stack` mode.

### Example usage

```yaml
docker_network: my_network
docker_network_driver: overlay
docker_network_attachable: true
```

## Rollback Behaviour

This action supports automatic rollback if a deployment fails to start correctly.

### How it works

- In `stack` mode:
  - Docker Swarm‚Äôs built-in rollback is used.
  - The command `docker service update --rollback <service-name>` is run to revert services in the stack to the last working state.

- In `compose` mode:
  - A backup of the current deployment file is created before deployment.
  - If services fail to start, the backup is restored and Compose is re-deployed.
  - If rollback is successful, the backup file is removed to avoid stale data.

### Rollback triggers

Rollback will occur if:
- Services fail health checks.
- Containers immediately exit after starting.
- Docker returns an error during service startup.

Rollback will not occur if:
- The deployment succeeds but the application has internal errors.
- A service is manually stopped by the user.
- Rollback is disabled via `enable_rollback: false`.

          extra_files: .env,database.env,nginx.conf  
          mode: compose
          docker_network: myapp_network
          docker_network_driver: bridge
          docker_prune: system
          registry_host: docker.io

```

## Requirements on the Server

- Docker must be installed
- Docker Compose (if using `compose` mode)
- Docker Swarm must be initialised (if using `stack` mode)
- SSH access must be configured for the provided user and key

## Important Notes

- This action is designed for Linux servers (Debian, Ubuntu, Alpine, CentOS)
- The SSH user must have permissions to write files and run Docker commands
- If the `project_path` does not exist, it will be created with permissions `750` and owned by the provided SSH user
- If using Swarm mode, the target machine must be a Swarm manager

## Tips for Maintainers

- Test the full process locally before using in GitHub Actions
- Always use GitHub Secrets for sensitive values like SSH keys
- Make sure firewall rules allow SSH access from GitHub runners
